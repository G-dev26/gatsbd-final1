                <p>Behind these little things about you is a girl who just wants to be lovedâ€”proudly and clearly. I may not have known you for a whole year, but somehow, it felt like I've known you forever. I got you. I understood you. I've learned the little ways you think, to the point I could confidently say "am ammo ka," and be right. You probably even smiled before opening this letter lol I love you. Those were my small joysâ€”my little victories with you.</p>

                <p>The Gatsbie I got to know may have just been a version of someone you once were, but if I could choose, I'd still pick youâ€”my Gatsbie. Even if life eventually introduces me to your other versions, I'd still take the time to understand and love each one of them, patiently and sincerely.</p>

                <p>To the person I adore the mostâ€”Gatsbieâ€”happiest birthday, my love. I saw how much you've struggled and triumphed during your first year, and I'm so proud. I'm wishing with all my heart to see a more driven, more passionate Gatsbie in her sophomore year. Go get that degree, my future Chemical Engineer! And if ever you need Ate's help, don't even hesitate. I'm always here. I'm all ears for my favorite ading, and I promise to help in any way I can.</p>

                <p>Thank you for the time, the laughter, the quiet momentsâ€”just being together, doing our things side by side. Thank you for listening to my rants, my chikas, my stupid jokes, and for doing my lazy little favors. Thank you for being patient, for understanding me, for giving advice that always hit right where it should. Thank you for letting me fall asleep on your lap while you were studying, always making sure I was comfortable, making sure my head didn't hurt. It became my habit, you know? And the thought that I won't be able to do that anymoreâ€”it breaks my heart.</p>

                <p>The idea of us not doing the things we used toâ€¦ it shatters me. I want you back. I want my baby back. I want my Gatsbie. Your voice was the only thing I wanted to hear first thing in the morning. Your kissesâ€”soft and perfect. Your hugsâ€”warm, safe, and irreplaceable. I've never felt that kind of comfort with anyone else. Sometimes, I wish I could still call you mine. But today, I'm letting go, fully and completely. I'm grateful I got to say that, you were once mine.</p>

                <p>So when the time comes that you're fully healed and ready to love again, I hope the one who finds you will love you like Ravi doesâ€”showering you with kind words, hyping you up in the most adorable, thoughtful ways. I hope they treasure you like Tita Julie and Tito Ryan doâ€”so purely, so unconditionally. I hope they care for your heart the way Lola Vergie cares for your wellbeingâ€”always asking how you really are, always trying to ease your burdens. I hope they become your safe place, your home. Someone who will believe in your dreams, walk with you through every risk, and never doubt your strength, even when you do. Someone whose mission is to see you reach your goal as your most beautiful, most fulfilled self.</p>

                <p>I would've loved to give you a better giftâ€”something you could open from time to time. But then I realized: I want you to fully move on. This is my last act of love, my final act of service. I want you to love freely again, without guilt, without wondering if I still hold a piece of you. Like I saidâ€”like we saidâ€”I should not be counted anymore.</p>

                <p>So thank you, for reading until the very end. I hope today turns out to be everything you deserveâ€”fun, warm, beautiful, and unforgettable.</p>

                <p class="signature">xoxo, your <span class="crossed-out">lover</span> Ate ðŸ’‹</p>
