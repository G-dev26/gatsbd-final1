                        <p>&emsp;My Dearest Gatsbie,</p>
                        <p>&emsp;As I sit here, quietly reminiscing the pages of our journey, my heart is overflowing with gratitude for the love we once shared. From our first kulitans and inumans, to the galahans and horror movie nights that made us laugh and scream together — every moment we created has become a precious gem in the treasure of my heart.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;You brought color into my life in ways I never thought possible. With you, even the most ordinary days felt extraordinary. You taught me how to love without fear, to be present, and to feel again — and for that, I will always be thankful.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;You deserve the best, always. You deserve to shine, to thrive, and to become everything you’ve ever dreamed of. And I know with all my heart that when you work hard and stay true to who you are, you'll become something even greater than you ever imagined.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;I hope today, on your 19th birthday, you don’t feel any birthday blues. Please, cheer up my baby — you’ve come so far and have so much to look forward to. Go enjoy your day and celebrate the amazing soul that you are. I hope you feel special not just today, but tomorrow and all the days after that.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;What made our love special was how we grew alongside each other. We celebrated each other's wins, wiped each other’s tears, and held hands through every storm. It wasn’t perfect, but it was real. And in those imperfect moments, we found a kind of love that many only dream of.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;But now, our journey has come to an end — not because the love disappeared, but because of my own recklessness and immaturity. I know I’ve hurt you, and I carry the weight of that regret every day. I am deeply sorry for all the pain I caused.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;Thank you for understanding me even when I couldn’t find the words. For supporting my dreams, for loving me in all my flawed ways, and for showing me what it means to be truly cared for — those are gifts I will carry with me forever.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;As we part ways, please know this: I will always keep our memories close. I’ll continue to root for you from afar. I’ll be your silent supporter, your biggest cheerleader, even if it’s no longer by your side.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;Thank you for letting me feel what it’s like to be truly loved again. Thank you for letting me be a part of your world.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;Happy 19th Birthday, my love.<br>
                        &emsp;Wherever life takes you, I hope you find joy, peace, and the kind of love that feels like home.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;Always,<br>
                        &emsp;G</p>
